# 1-Roadmap-Project
This project was developed using Python, a powerful and versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. The goal of the project is to [briefly explain what your project does — e.g., "build a number analyzer", "create a web scraper", "simulate a game", etc.].

Python was chosen for this project due to its wide range of libraries, easy syntax, and rapid development capabilities. The code is modular, clean, and well-documented to help others understand and learn from it.

Feel free to explore, run the code, and suggest improvements!
